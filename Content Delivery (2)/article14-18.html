        <h1>Article 14: Equality Before Law</h1>
        <p>
          *The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the
          equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.
        </p>
        <p>
          *No one is above the law, not even the government or its officials.
          Everyone is subject to the same laws and is entitled to the same legal
          protection
        </p>
        <p>
          * Article 14 prohibits discrimination by the state against any
          individual or group. For instance, the government cannot make laws
          that apply differently to different people without a valid reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          *In Simple Words: Article 14 ensures that everyone is treated equally
          by the law and has equal access to legal protection. It prevents any
          unfair or unreasonable discrimination by the state. However, it also
          recognizes that treating everyone exactly the same is not always fair
          and allows for different treatment where there is a reasonable basis,
          such as helping disadvantaged groups to achieve true equality.

          permission. This helps in fostering a more equal and united society.
