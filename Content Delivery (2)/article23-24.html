          <h1>Right Against Exploitation(23-24)</h1>
          <p>
            Part III of the Constitution deal with Fundamental Rights. These
            are: Right to equality, including equality before law, prohibition
            of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place
            of birth, and equality of opportunity in matters of employment.

          Article 23: Prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labour
        </h1>
        <p>
          * traffic in human beings and begar and other similar forms of forced
          labour are prohibited and any contravention of this provision shall be
          an offence punishable in accordance with law.
        </p>
        <p>
          * Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from imposing
          compulsory service for public purposes, and in imposing such service
          the State shall not make any discrimination on grounds only of
          religion, race, caste or class or any of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          * The Supreme Court of India has issued several landmark judgments
          that expand the scope of Article 23, ensuring that any form of forced
          labor, whether direct or indirect, is curbed and penalized. The courts
          have also laid down directives for the rehabilitation of victims of
          human trafficking and bonded labor.
        </p>
        <p>
          *In Simple Words: Article 23 is significant as it safeguards
          individual freedom and dignity, protecting citizens from exploitation
          and ensuring that every person is treated with respect and justice. It
          also reflects India's commitment to uphold human rights and eliminate
          practices that violate human dignity.

          Article 24: Prohibition of employment of children in factories, etc.
        </h1>
        <p>
          * Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14
          years in any factory, mine, or any other hazardous employment. The
          intent is to protect children from working in conditions that are
          dangerous to their health, safety, and moral development.
        </p>
        <p>
          * The prohibition under Article 24 applies specifically to employment
          in hazardous industries and occupations. It does not extend to all
          forms of work or employment. For example, non-hazardous work like
          child artists in films or children helping in family businesses
          (non-hazardous) may not be directly covered under this prohibition.
        </p>
        <p>
          * The Supreme Court of India and various High Courts have played an
          active role in interpreting Article 24 to prevent child labor and
          uphold the rights of children. For instance, the courts have directed
          the government to ensure that children are not employed in industries
          such as matchbox manufacturing, carpet weaving, and mining, which are
          hazardous in nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          * Article 24 is crucial in safeguarding the rights of children,
          ensuring their safety, and protecting them from exploitation. It
          underscores India's commitment to securing a safe and nurturing
          environment for children, facilitating their education and overall
          development. This provision also aligns with international
          commitments, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of
          the Child, which India ratified in 1992.
